2. in tableau, there are tableau and tableau server, you can use broswer to login in tableau server and check some data and setting. 
3. what's the difference between .hypher files and .tde files. It seems like hyper files are updated to tde fies.
4. are sql server files .mdf encryped?(or are they safe?)  Seems like no and here's why we need "Transparent data encryped".

question collection to david:
1. does every table in david_test has no relationships with each other?
2. are the tableau server's data from sql server? or the data is just saved in tableau's own databases.
3. It seems like table server's database collect the columns from sql server's tables?
4. what is tableau data engine? i saw this one on tableau server?
5. why do we have p_日报, t_日报 , what's the difference between them and why do we need them both at the same time?
6. how tableau server connect to mssql server?

2022/8/24

1. study about david's code and trying to understand the relationship between "ETL" and david's python code, 
I was wondering it's doing the "ETL" job
2. Compared the coding files between taiwinner's production server and test server and i find that test server has 
files than production files, in a sense that means that the test server is more general than the production server.
3. tried to figure out if the gitRepo folder in test server actually git all the files in that server actually needs.
4. I just found that in Taiwinner's production server, there's no crawler script. that means that the test server does
the crawler??.
5. ok, i know why tableau server use .hyper files, it's because tableau server is slow when directly connect to 
sql server, but if you directly use .hyper files, then the speed would way more faster.



questions collection to david:
1. why do we use hyper file rather than just using directly connection between sql server and tableau server?
2. David use git for versino control, but the problem is why didn't david use git repository code as the running code.
He used git only for code version control but didn't use the code in git repository but seems like copying them to other
folder outside the gitRepo folder and use them, why? why not just use the gitRepo's code?
3. Only the test server does the crawler script?? or Production server does crawler too???
4. what does attendance_record folder do in python script??

questions collection to david:
1. why did david use selenium for crawlers script?
2. why in crawlers script, david need to download the chrome driver and zip the file?? why did he need to use chrome driver
when the driver is already in the server.
3. i was really confused right now, in david's code it seems like david only crawled the chrome driver?? but not the 
customer's rate data???
4. why did david use pycharm, why do we use it?

1. What's the difference between "support vector machine" and "Logistic regression" in theory way and practical way? here's some reference talk about this:
https://medium.com/axum-labs/logistic-regression-vs-support-vector-machines-svm-c335610a3d16
in this website above you can search "distance between the line and the support vectors" then you would find a perfect answers.

Here's some reference talk about the difference between logistic regression and linear regression:
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-support-vector-machines-SVM-compared-with-linear-regression-or-logistic-regression  # the first answer reply a good explanation
https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10269006   # in this website you can search "線性迴歸與邏輯迴歸"

the logistic model would always be linear because you suppose the model to be something like this: w1*x1+w2*x2+b = 0  and it is "linear" !! And then you take this kinda thing to 
sigmoid function. So the result must be linear.




2. well, it seems like "logistic regression" and "support vector machine" both use vector coefficients but the next steps they use different method to fit the 
boundary?? here's some reference:

1. I was studying machine learning, and I was already to know the binary classification problem but can't still understand how to classified three classification problem.
So I was trying to use "vsm(vector support machine)" method to deal with the "iris" flower problem which is a three classification problem.
2. when i use iris flower data, the data i loaded from internet was got arranged, so i have to make it more random, you can use train_test_split function to separate the 
train data and test data, it's very convinent. Here's some reference talks about this:
https://blog.csdn.net/qq_43391414/article/details/112909834
3. when i use train_test_split function in sklearn here's a very import two parameters for function you should know:
	a. random_state=??  ---> which would make the data separate with a randomness. The number of the this argument is kinda like seed which would make result the same 
when you set this argument the same.
	b. test_size(or you can use train_size) this is the percentage of the train and test data you want to separate
4. how can i draw three dimensions data in two dimension diagram(which is the normal diagram)?? Here's the usage of "scatter matrix" which you were gonna use this in iris example

Here are some references talk about this: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41512872/can-malloc-be-used-to-define-the-size-of-an-array
They key point is that the malloc would create an "annoymous" array which you can only know the pointer of that array. So you 
can't size of it. All you can do is track the size by yourself.

	a. tableau server install in a new windows machine, and sql server leave in the old machine.  In this plan, windows is very expensive. But the befits
	is that you can use a new machine to install the newest tableau server which has high probability to successes.
	b. sql server install in a new linux machine, and tableau server leave in the old one.  In this plan, linux is more cheap than windows server.
	almost free. So this plan's befit is "cheap".

Here's some reference you can solve this problem:

用
select * from 中華民國地址 where 城市 like N'%桃園%'
試試.


---------------------------------------------------------------

可以了 感謝

但為什麼 要加 N 呢??

之前 TRY 都不用

是不是 我的 SERVER 有設定上的問題??

因為 另外一台 就可以 不需要 N

---------------------------------------------------------------

您的欄位" 城市 " 型態應該是定成NVarchar,而不是Varchar,所以在insert,update,select時,要加N


---------------------------------------------------------------
但是 我 另外一台 SERVER 也是 NVarchar
一樣 都可以耶

那 N 代表什麼意思呢

感謝


---------------------------------------------------------------

這主要是因為資料庫屬性中有個定序的設定問題.
假如你的定序設定是用Chinese_Taiwan.....的話,
不用加N也是可以的.

3. review about the http request command line tool "curl", here's some references talk about this:
https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_41287260/article/details/119851086
4. In curl commands, you can use -X to change http request method, for example:
curl -X GET http://www.google.com --verbose    ---> this would show the method "get"
curl -X POST http://www.google.com --verbose    ---> this would show the medhotd "post"
5. In curl commands, when you use: curl --request (which is curl -X) POST --verbose http://google.com -d "testData", How can you show the data content in respose?
here's some references(It seems like there's no way to show it by curl commands)
https://superuser.com/questions/291424/how-do-you-display-post-data-with-curl

curl --request POST http://34.124.166.158/api/3.17/auth/signin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @login.json --verbose
And you have the site's id and auth token you can get the view id from command:
curl --request GET http://34.124.166.158/api/3.17/sites/7ebac3d3-55b7-4cc1-87f3-e55da6ec1437/views  -H "X-Tableau-Auth:tHc010hNQ_CZ9iIFjyidhw|aITMcKzT8GIXHGTkYFtskZqxLXUicj4u|7ebac3d3-55b7-4cc1-87f3-e55da6ec1437"  --verbose
which "X-Tableau_Auth" is the credential token

1. what exactly does machine learning do? (basic)
假設使用的是邏輯回歸:
	1. 第一步, 需要有數據(可能是二維的數據, 或更高維度的數據, 但通常不會是一維的數據), 這些數據的某個值會是1 or 0, 例如x = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 4]], y = [1, 0, 1]
	2. 接下來, 有了數據之後, 需要把數據進行"邏輯回歸", 找到最佳的線性方程, 我們可以用這個線性方程去預測未知的數值, 分類之後的數值會直接是1 or 0.
	3. 如果是分類問題的話可以使用sigmoid function 作為"激活函數(activation function)", "激活函數"其實就是最後數據要進行二元分類的時候, 可以使用這個函數去計算, 不一定是sigmoid, 也可以是tanh或其他的.

假設使用線性回歸:
	線性回歸的輸入x = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5]], y = [3, 4, 6]
	y 不一定是0 or 1. 線性回歸的目的在於預測y的值, 而邏輯回歸的目的在於直接分類y, y的值是[0, 1], 當然y的值也可能不只兩個, 例如[0, 1, 2]
You can also use VSM:

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/92171/what-do-eigenvalues-have-to-do-with-pictures
https://blog.csdn.net/AddVH/article/details/106312289
7. I saw some people use "PIL" python library to deal with images but I remember there's another library called "opencv" So what's the difference between both of them?  
Here's a reference talks about this:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-opencv-image-to-pil-image-in-python/
8. Here's another reference talk about how to use eigenvalue and eigenvector of a picture:
手寫數字識別:
https://www.k2zone.cn/?p=977
In the article above, the it talk about "feature vectors" which is not the same as eigenvectors.


2023/2/2
1. It seems like if we want to find the eigenvalue and eigenvector of an image
or a picture, we need to use "singular value decomposition(奇異值分解(SVD))" 
You should definitey check it out:
https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%87%E5%BC%82%E5%80%BC%E5%88%86%E8%A7%A3
here's another reference: this talks about how to compress image by .
https://yadominjinta.github.io/2019/12/02/Image-compression-and-linear-alegebra.html
3. what is "EigenDecomposition(特徵分解)"?
eigenDecomposition is actually doing this kinda thing below:
A = QTQ^-1   which is decomposite matrix A into diagnozied matrix T(which is composed by eigenvalue) and Q which is composed by eigenvector.
4. how to make any indepent basis to normalized orthogonal basis?? YOU CAN USE "Schmidt normalization"
5. eigenDecomposition only works on square matrix but SVD can works on rather just that.
6. about the confusion of orthogonalization of eigenvector, here's some
reference talksk about this:
https://www.quora.com/How-is-it-possible-to-orthogonalize-eigenvectors-when-they-are-not-orthogonal
7. use schmidt method to normalized vectors, here's reference:
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/136627868
8. For symetry matrix, you can turn eigenvectors to normalized orthogonal matrix but only for symmetry matrix, here's some reference:
https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%81%E5%88%86%E8%A7%A3
9. But why do we use SVD (why use singular value?) what does singular value
do?
10. Normalization of eigenValue, here's some reference:

linear algebra!!! Here are some reference talk about this:
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/73497541
4. Review about c language, how is the pointer works??
for example, "pointer of an array" and "array pointer":
	// pointer of an array"
	int (*arrayP)[10];     //  the operator precedence is this: "()", "[]", "*". Refernece: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence 
	// So that means that this line of code means that 
	arrayP取值之後是一個有[10]的元素的array, 且每個元素的datatype都是int

	// array pointer
	int *pArray[10];
	// the code means that 
	pArray是一個陣列, 且每一個元素取值之後都是int, 這表示每個元素都是一個指向int的指標

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22718/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-regression-on-y-with-x-and-x-with-y
here's another reference:
https://www.zhihu.com/question/57431366
I think this is because of statics of y and x is different, which make regression x on y and regression y on x are not the same.
8. In "least square" regression problem, the loss function is actually "Sigma(y-yp)^2", because accoding to the definitions we know that, the loss function
should be the function that need to be minimized? You can see the wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_function
9. I was trying to create newton's method to solve least square problem but I failed. I remember that I used to make it done before. Here's a reference You

1. I was trying to use telegram restful api of "sendMediaGroup" to send two images and it works!! Here's the reference:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73717024/how-to-send-photos-with-multipart-form-data-in-media-group-with-python-requests
2. After trying again and again, I started wondering if the "sendMediaGroup" can't send files unless the files are already in the server?? Here's some refereces talk about this:
https://github.com/unreal4u/telegram-api/issues/76
still suspect that "sendMediaGroup" can't send local files, here's another reference:

2. In neural network, when you want to save or load the training result models you can save it as json files. Here' some reference talk about this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55102781/how-to-save-and-load-my-neural-network-model-after-training-along-with-weights-i
3. What language does "stable diffusion" use? It seems like it use python. But if it use python then it should i kinda slow??
4. Can I use "C language" to build the neural network training model??
5. I think I should try to build some test python lib by c or c++. When you still have times.
6. Try to practice c++.

1. I keep studying about a math subject "why Guassian curvature is intrinsic,how can i explain it with a simple idea"?
here's some ideas i think you can consider about:
https://www.britannica.com/science/differential-geometry/Curvature-of-surfaces
2. In Guassian curvature i think i lost the goal of what i should prove that makes we can't prove the right thing. 
I think there's a hint about what should i really prove: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature
Gauss's Theorema egregium (Latin: "remarkable theorem") states that Gaussian curvature of a surface can be determined from the measurements of length on the surface itself. 
In fact, it can be found given the full knowledge of the first fundamental
form and expressed via the first fundamental form and its partial derivatives
of first and second order. Here's some reference:
https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature
3. what is the gemoetric meaning of the coefficients of the first fundamental form?
4. In taiwinner, You should try to testing create folders in ga_data and make sure that you can put the files in that folder.
5. I think you should really really need to understand "the first fundamental form" and not just only know that first fundamental form is "ds", here's wiki:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_fundamental_form
6. In first fundamental form, there's one import thing called "metric tensor", I think should really need to know:
度量張量在黎曼幾何裡面又叫黎曼度量，物理學譯為度規張量，是指一用來衡量度量空間中距離，面積及角度的二階張量。
7. Here's another reference talk about the area using the "first fundamental form"

8. Here's another reference talk about why Gaussian curvature is invariant under isometry transformation:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/434267/gaussian-curvature-invariant-under-an-isometry
9. Any isometry preserves the length and angle?? Here's some reference:
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1131642/isometries-preserving-distance-but-not-angles
10. About isometry preserves about the angle?

1. What exactly make the accuracy can't go any higher in neural network? Here might be a reason:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42998307/how-to-solve-the-issue-testing-accuracy-reduce-during-iterations
2. I keep fail to improve digit recognization accuracy, but this time, holy shit!!! It works. 
I use 500 training data, and 3000 hundred iteration and use learning rate accoroding as a function of iteration number! And the accuracy is 97%!! oh my god!
3. But!! when I increase the number of the test data, the same thing happens again the accuracy fall down!!
4. What is the difference between "validation set" and "test set". It seems like they are almost the same.
5. What if I use the trained model to test "training data" ?? What accuray would I get??
6. How do i use vim to compile latex file to pdf, here's some referece:
