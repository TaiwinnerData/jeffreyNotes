2. in tableau, there are tableau and tableau server, you can use broswer to login in tableau server and check some data and setting. 
3. what's the difference between .hypher files and .tde files. It seems like hyper files are updated to tde fies.
4. are sql server files .mdf encryped?(or are they safe?)  Seems like no and here's why we need "Transparent data encryped".

question collection to david:
1. does every table in david_test has no relationships with each other?
2. are the tableau server's data from sql server? or the data is just saved in tableau's own databases.
3. It seems like table server's database collect the columns from sql server's tables?
4. what is tableau data engine? i saw this one on tableau server?
5. why do we have p_日报, t_日报 , what's the difference between them and why do we need them both at the same time?
6. how tableau server connect to mssql server?

2022/8/24

1. study about david's code and trying to understand the relationship between "ETL" and david's python code, 
I was wondering it's doing the "ETL" job
2. Compared the coding files between taiwinner's production server and test server and i find that test server has 
files than production files, in a sense that means that the test server is more general than the production server.
3. tried to figure out if the gitRepo folder in test server actually git all the files in that server actually needs.
4. I just found that in Taiwinner's production server, there's no crawler script. that means that the test server does
the crawler??.
5. ok, i know why tableau server use .hyper files, it's because tableau server is slow when directly connect to 
sql server, but if you directly use .hyper files, then the speed would way more faster.



questions collection to david:
1. why do we use hyper file rather than just using directly connection between sql server and tableau server?
2. David use git for versino control, but the problem is why didn't david use git repository code as the running code.
He used git only for code version control but didn't use the code in git repository but seems like copying them to other
folder outside the gitRepo folder and use them, why? why not just use the gitRepo's code?
3. Only the test server does the crawler script?? or Production server does crawler too???
4. what does attendance_record folder do in python script??

questions collection to david:
1. why did david use selenium for crawlers script?
2. why in crawlers script, david need to download the chrome driver and zip the file?? why did he need to use chrome driver
when the driver is already in the server.
3. i was really confused right now, in david's code it seems like david only crawled the chrome driver?? but not the 
customer's rate data???
4. why did david use pycharm, why do we use it?

1. What's the difference between "support vector machine" and "Logistic regression" in theory way and practical way? here's some reference talk about this:
https://medium.com/axum-labs/logistic-regression-vs-support-vector-machines-svm-c335610a3d16
in this website above you can search "distance between the line and the support vectors" then you would find a perfect answers.

Here's some reference talk about the difference between logistic regression and linear regression:
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-support-vector-machines-SVM-compared-with-linear-regression-or-logistic-regression  # the first answer reply a good explanation
https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10269006   # in this website you can search "線性迴歸與邏輯迴歸"

the logistic model would always be linear because you suppose the model to be something like this: w1*x1+w2*x2+b = 0  and it is "linear" !! And then you take this kinda thing to 
sigmoid function. So the result must be linear.




2. well, it seems like "logistic regression" and "support vector machine" both use vector coefficients but the next steps they use different method to fit the 
boundary?? here's some reference:

3. how can you print number result without scientific notation, for example,
if i want to print my results as 0.0001 rather than 1.0000e_05 ,because maybe
i want to use this result as data to do something. Here's some reference:

2. in sql server, what's the difference between "delete from table" and "drop table" and "truncate table"? here's some reference: 
https://dotblogs.com.tw/brian/2013/03/22/98648 
the key point is that using "delete from" would cause a lotta memories, it's not a good way to delete whole table data.

1. I was studying machine learning, and I was already to know the binary classification problem but can't still understand how to classified three classification problem.
So I was trying to use "vsm(vector support machine)" method to deal with the "iris" flower problem which is a three classification problem.
2. when i use iris flower data, the data i loaded from internet was got arranged, so i have to make it more random, you can use train_test_split function to separate the 
train data and test data, it's very convinent. Here's some reference talks about this:
https://blog.csdn.net/qq_43391414/article/details/112909834
3. when i use train_test_split function in sklearn here's a very import two parameters for function you should know:
	a. random_state=??  ---> which would make the data separate with a randomness. The number of the this argument is kinda like seed which would make result the same 
when you set this argument the same.
	b. test_size(or you can use train_size) this is the percentage of the train and test data you want to separate
4. how can i draw three dimensions data in two dimension diagram(which is the normal diagram)?? Here's the usage of "scatter matrix" which you were gonna use this in iris example
5. I want to use scatter_matrix function and pandas has one but what about matplotlib? doesn't it have one?

1. when you want to scrape something that is rendered by javascript which is basically cannot be scraped by normal method, you can use selenium.
Or you would have a high probability to find the data you want in <script> tag. I scrape something inside <script> tag and find the exchange rate data i want.

1. I think i have already know the basic idea behind the machine learning classification problem and i want test something more.
2. I was planning to start learning neural network and deep learning.
3. Now the first question came up. What is the difference between "neural network" and "deep learning". 
Well, it seems like "deep learning" is a subject and "neural network" is a solution model to it, here's some referene talk about this:
https://www.zhihu.com/question/26017374
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-a-neural-network-and-a-deep-learning-system/
4. What's the difference between "Neural Network" and "SVM". It seems like they are all a kinda machine learning model.

2. English note:  backpropagation, darn
3. The key point between single peceptron in neural network and multiple layer of neural network is "hidden layers"
4. What does the node mean in deep learning diagram? here are some reference talk about this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHzaWO2mGuA
Well, basically, nodes actually mean a number that has been calculated by weight.
5. I am kinda confused right now... What is the difference between "neuron" and "node"??
6. how to build a simple basic neural network with only 3 simple layers, here's an simple tutorial referece talk about this: 
this example is very import because it doesn't use any lib and show the basic idea about the what deep learning exactly does:

1. I reviewed about c language, pointer, array, pointer array, array of pointer, something like that.
2. I reviewed about c language, dynamic memory, static memory.
3. I reviewed about c language, struct, define, construct, something like that.
4. why does c language has no memory check mechansm, the point is c language allowing undefineed behavior happens:

1. I was keeping studying about c language, how to use realloc function to reset the memory i want to give to a variable.
2. I was reviewing about how chars and strings works in c language and here's some reference talk about this:
this is the probabily best practice for creating string in c language:
https://www.tutorialandexample.com/null-character-in-c
3. You can use "sizeof" function to determine the byte size of the array datatype. That's how you check how many byte length you can use in c language
array, here's a reference talks about this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37538/how-do-i-determine-the-size-of-my-array-in-c
4. But here raise another question, does dynamics memory can use this same "sizeof" technique? I have to test this out.
5. the size of a poiner in c language, here's some reference talks about this:
https://www.scaler.com/topics/size-of-a-pointer-in-c/
6. what is the difference between "int array[10];" and "(int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*10);", they both create array but here are still some difference between them.
Here are some references talk about this: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41512872/can-malloc-be-used-to-define-the-size-of-an-array
They key point is that the malloc would create an "annoymous" array which you can only know the pointer of that array. So you 
can't size of it. All you can do is track the size by yourself.
7. This website give you a very good example of how to use c language to create a project including phonebook and calendar.

8. i was reciewing about how to use c language to read file and write file


2022/12/14
1. I was reviewing about c language, how to read a file and write a file content in c language. And compare the method of reading file and write file with python.
2. I was reading about how to use fscanf and how it works. It seems like it can remember the position you've already read. here's a reference talks about this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24523431/reading-files-how-file-pointer-is-moved-using-fscanf-and-how-scanf-fscanf-work

1. I was reviewing about c language, how to use struct.
2. I gradually remembered how to use struct. when you want to use struct to some variable. it some kinda would need uncertain size of variable so you need to use
dynamic memory to create struct variable. here's some reference talks about:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62979813/when-do-we-use-structure-variable-and-structure-pointer
3. about c language object oriented Progamming. You can create object as you want. here's some references talks about this:
https://www.zhihu.com/question/59292999
4. I was studying about how to use pointer function in c language.

2022/12/16
1. If you want to create a struct in c language you have to use dynamic memory to that. Or you would get memory wrong alert.
2. I was modified moduleCleanFunct for taiwinner. I think that sucks.
